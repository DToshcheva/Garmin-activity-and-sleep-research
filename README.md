# Garmin-activity-and-sleep-research
Sleep and activity research based on Garmin watch data

The results of the study are divided into three parts: 
1) Data preprocessing;
2) Sleep duration research;
3) Finding a correlation between sleep duration and activity indicators the day before.

### **Conclusions:**

**I. Sleep structure.**
1) REM sleep phase (function: consolidation of procedural memory == memorization of skills) average duration is 1 hour (17.5% of the total duration of sleep, below the recommended norm (20%-25%))
2) Deep sleep (function: memory structuring, recovery processes in tissues) average duration is 40 minutes (13.5% of the total sleep duration, below the recommended norm (15%-20%)

**II. Sleep duration and start time.**
1) The average start time of sleep is about 01:30 (AM)
2) Average sleep duration - 7.5 hours
3) The start time of sleep is strongly influenced by the work schedule (noticeable shifts due to overwork at the beginning of the month, and in busy periods in May-August)
4) Since September 2022, there is noticeable deterioration in the start time of sleep and the duration of sleep (due to suffer from insomnia)
5) Since December 2022, the start time of sleep and awakening is shifted - due to dismissal from work

**III. Correlation between sleep duration and activity indicators the day before.**
1) There is no correlation between the duration of deep sleep and the indicators of activity the day before;
2) There is a weak correlation between the duration of REM sleep and RHR (Resting Heart Rate);
3) There is no correlation between the duration of REM sleep and other (other than RHR) indicators of activity on the eve;
4) note: despite the presence of outliers, the correlation coefficient without taking them into account will not be high for all indicators (graphically there is no dependence)

Initial data from Garmin watch (Sleep Data, Activity Data and others) can be requested by following the link: https://www.garmin.com/ru-RU/account/datamanagement/.

Within 30 days (usually a couple of days is enough), a link will be sent to the mail to download the archive with the data.
